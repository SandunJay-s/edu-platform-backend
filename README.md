## **Prerequisites**

Before starting deployment, ensure you have the following:

- Docker installed on your local machine.
- AWS account credentials with access to Amazon EKS for Kubernetes deployment.
- Vercel account for hosting the frontend.
- Access to the source code repository.

---

## **Backend Deployment**

### **1. Dockerizing the Spring Boot Microservices**

1. Navigate to the root directory of each microservice.
2. Create a Dockerfile in each microservice directory.
3. Add the necessary instructions to Dockerfile, including dependencies installation and application startup commands.
4. Build Docker images for each microservice using the `docker build` command.
5. Tag the built images appropriately.
6. Push the Docker images to a container registry like Docker Hub or AWS ECR.

### **2. Deploying with Kubernetes on AWS**

1. Set up an Amazon EKS cluster in your AWS account.
2. Configure `kubectl` to connect to your EKS cluster.
3. Define Kubernetes deployment YAML files for each microservice, including service definitions.
4. Apply the deployment YAML files using `kubectl apply` command to deploy microservices to the EKS cluster.
5. Expose the microservices using an AWS Load Balancer or Ingress Controller.
6. Monitor the deployment using Kubernetes dashboard or CLI commands.

## **Frontend Deployment**

### **1. Deploying Next.js with React on Vercel**

1. Log in to your Vercel account.
2. Import your Next.js project repository into Vercel.
3. Configure deployment settings such as environment variables, domains, and deployment triggers.
4. Trigger a manual deployment or set up automatic deployments on code changes.
5. Monitor the deployment process and verify the deployed application on the provided Vercel domain.

## **Conclusion**

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed your Spring Boot microservices project with Docker containerization, Kubernetes orchestration on AWS, and deployed the frontend built with Next.js and React on Vercel. Ensure to monitor the deployed services for any issues and make necessary optimizations for performance and scalability.

For any questions or issues, refer to the project documentation or reach out to the project team.
